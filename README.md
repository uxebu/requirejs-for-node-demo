Goal
====

This project wants to demonstrate the correct use of requirejs for node.js
projects, including all edge cases, and serves for documenting how we (in uxebu)
use the setup.
It shall include the pure setup, test execution and building.
If any new edge cases come up, they shall be added here, so we always
have one demo ref that is testable and shows how to use the setup correctly.
If anything is missing feel free to open a ticket.
